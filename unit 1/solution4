#4. Create and store a vector that contains, in any configuration, the following:
     i. A sequence of integers from 6 to 12 (inclusive)
     ii. A threefold repetition of the value 5.3
     iii. The number -3
     iv. A sequence of nine values starting at 102 and ending at the number that is the total
         length of the vector created in (3.)

#(i)
> x<-c(6:12)
> x

#(ii)
> y<-rep(5.3,times=3)
> y

#(iii)
> z<--3
> z

#(iv)
> prelen<-100
> final<-seq(102,100,length.out=9)
> final
