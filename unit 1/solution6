#6. Create and store a vector that contains the following, in this order:
     i. A sequence of length 5 from 3 to 6 (inclusive)
     ii. A twofold repetition of the vector c(2,-5.1,-33)
     iii. The value 7/42 + 2 


#(i)
> x<-seq(3,6,length.out=5)
> x

#(ii)
> y<-rep(c(2,-5.1,-33),times=2)
> y

#(iii)
> z<-7/42+2
> z

> final<-c(x,y,z)
> final
